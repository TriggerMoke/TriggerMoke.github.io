| Notes | It has been a rough end to this semester so i restarted this project like 17 times. As a result of not being able to figure react out i don't really have much to show. I am really at your mercy now, i would appreciate not failing the class....  My final plan after restarting was to have 5 components that were unique and that could be unit tested fairly easily but i have already restarted so many times and i just can't do it anymore... my brain is just so fried :( sorry |
